# Marvel-Iris-Project
Project for Data Science
This analysis uses NetworkX and Pandas to explore connections between Marvel superheroes, answering questions such as:

Which superheroes are most influential? (Using centrality measures)
Who has the fewest connections?
How many total connections exist in the Marvel Universe?

I created a Python class that manages a machine-learning Iris dataset stored in a MySQL database. It supports: 
Creating & using a database
Creating & managing a table
Loading data from sklearn into MySQL
Querying, updating, and deleting records
