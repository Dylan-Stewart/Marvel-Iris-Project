# Marvel-MySQL-Project  
## Project for Data Science  

### Part 1: Superhero Network Analysis  
Using NetworkX and Pandas, I analyze connections between Marvel superheroes to answer questions like:  

- **Which superheroes are most influential?** (Using centrality measures)  
- **Who has the fewest connections?**  
- **How many total connections exist in the Marvel Universe?**  

### Part 2: Iris Database Management  
I developed a Python class that manages an Iris dataset stored in a MySQL database. It supports:  

- **Creating and managing a database & table**  
- **Loading data from `sklearn` into MySQL**  
- **Querying, updating, and deleting records**
